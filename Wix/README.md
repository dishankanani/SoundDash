## The problem SoundDash solves

-   When it becomes hard to find your way out of the downward spiral caused by overwhelming stress and anxiety, try turning to music.
-   This inspired us to create a functional application that would be able to help those struggling with anxiety in their day-to-day life.
-   Experts believe music helps with anxiety by reducing levels of stress hormones in the body. So we are trying to make an app for helping people their stress free life. SoundDash Has a feature which is help to get information from their own daily activity that analyze activity and filter music accordingly.

### üíª Technologies

#### üîî Velo by Wix

We have implemented our website with Help of Velo by Wix, users where they can check music concert and music shows nearby and Top Rated Albums and Tracks.

#### üîê Spotify API

-   We are using Spotify API to analyze and track user's current track playing activity. Spotify Web API Provides endpoints to interact with music artists, albums, and tracks, directly from the Spotify Data Catalogue.

### üß† Challenges we ran into

-   Brainstorming: It took us a long time to develop a website that had a real societal influence.
-   Working with Spotify API, which we were unfamiliar with, working with different endpoints, managing our scope such that we delivered a genuine product.
-   As we are new to Velo by Wix, we face problems in getting the content properly with minimum lag.
-   Using Wix Cron Job Scheduling for constantly looking for users' activity was time-consuming as we are new to Time Scheduling but having Velo by Wix support, blogs and documentation was a bit easier.
-   As we are beginners to Node.js framework finding solutions for some problems was bit difficult compared to other frameworks.
